# Development Process

## Workflow
- Define specifications for the feature
- Write test cases before implementation (TDD approach)
- Break down the work into granular tasks
- Implement the changes following the .cursor/rules guidelines
- Use the Cursor agent workflow defined in .cursor/rules/03-memory-bank/core.mdc for AI-assisted development


## Branching
- Create feature branches using the naming convention: `feature/TASK-ID-description`
- Submit pull requests from feature branches to the `develop` branch
- Ensure at least one code owner approval before merging
- Follow the process checklist items for PR readiness
