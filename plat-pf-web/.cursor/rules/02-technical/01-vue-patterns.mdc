  # Vue Component Patterns
  - Use single-file components (.vue) with template, script, and style sections
  - Follow Vue 2 Options API patterns (data, computed, methods, watch, lifecycle hooks)
  - Use PascalCase for component names and kebab-case for component files
  - Always include a `name` property in components for debugging
  - Use scoped styles when possible to avoid CSS conflicts

  # Template Guidelines
  - Use kebab-case for HTML attributes and event names
  - Prefer v-if over v-show for conditional rendering
  - Use v-for with :key for list rendering
  - Use template refs for DOM access instead of direct DOM manipulation
  - Keep templates clean and readable with proper indentation

  # Script Guidelines
  - Use ES6+ features (arrow functions, destructuring, template literals)
  - Import components at the top of the script section
  - Use computed properties for derived data
  - Use methods for event handlers and business logic
  - Use watchers for reactive data changes
  - Follow the established store patterns with modules

  # Lifecycle Hooks
  - Use created() for initial data setup
  - Use mounted() for DOM manipulation and third-party library initialization
  - Use beforeDestroy() for cleanup (timers, event listeners, subscriptions)
  - Use updated() sparingly, prefer computed properties or watchers

  # Performance Optimization
  - Use v-once for static content that never changes
  - Implement proper component lifecycle management
  - Use computed properties for expensive operations
  - Follow the established loading state patterns
